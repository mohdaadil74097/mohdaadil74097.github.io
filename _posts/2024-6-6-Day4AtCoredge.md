**It's day four as a Linux Admin Trainee at Coredge and it is a great day!**

I am doing my task which is given by Satya my Trainer.

Here is  my today's task to do research on **VIM**

**VIM**

Vim is a text editor used in Linux, we can also say it is the updated
version of vi editor which is also a pre-installed text editor in every
linux machine.

**Vim has two types of mode.**

1. Insert Mode
2. Command Line Mode

**How to edit a file in linux with the help of Vim**

1. First you have to made a file by using touch,vim or nano and <filename> like touch eg.txt
2. Now you have to open the file in eg.txt
3. Give the command or press 'i' for insert mode.
4. After pressing 'i', now you can text in a file or you can edit a file.
5. After editing the file now you have to save the text in it and come back to terminal by putting
   escap key, 'w' for write and 'q' is for quite and ! .
6. Now your file has been edited.

**Playing with file inside the VIM**

We can do these things in command mode
syntax with number of lines use 'n' before the operation where 'n' stands for number of lines
1. **yy**-> Used for yanked or copying the lines.
