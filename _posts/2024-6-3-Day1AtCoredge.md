**It's day one as a Linux Admin Trainee at Coredge and it is a great day!**

I learned about the github by satya my trainee and Mohit my collegue. 
The team is helpful, and Iâ€™m excited to learn more and get better at my job!
I have learned some basics about the Github like how to make repository
and how to make changes in the github repo,etc.


**I have some answers of the questions asked by Satya like**

Q1-> What is the difference between Open Source and FOSS ?

Ans-> **Open Source** means sharing the technical code or content in particular community, community used it,
modify it, and make changes if there is a need or find
any bug or the code is having any loophole and again share with a 
particular community to use it.

**FOSS(Free and open source software)**
FOSS is also used for the same purpose like sharing the code of the software  ans ensuring users to 
use it and improve the code if there is any loophole modify it and share it back to a particular community.
