title: Day 1 At Coredge as a linux admin trainee
---
Date 2024-6-3
It's day one as a Linux Admin Trainee at Coredge and it is a great day!
I learned about the github by satya my trainee and Mohit my collegue. 
The team is helpful, and Iâ€™m excited to learn more and get better at my job!
I have learned some basics about the Github like how to make repository
and how to make changes in the github repo,etc.
