**What is OpenStack?**

OpenStack is an open-source software platform for creating and managing cloud computing infrastructure, including compute, storage, and networking resources, in both public and private cloud environments.

**Cloud Infrastructure:** It helps build and manage cloud environments, similar to those provided by major cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure.

**Key Components of OpenStack**

**Compute (Nova):** Manages virtual machines (VMs) and other instances that run on the cloud.

**Storage:**

**Block Storage (Cinder):** Manages volumes that can be attached to VMs.

**Object Storage (Swift):** Manages large amounts of unstructured data (like files and backups).

**Networking (Neutron):** Manages networking aspects like IP addresses, subnets, and routers.

**Dashboard (Horizon):** Provides a web-based user interface to interact with OpenStack services.

**Identity Service (Keystone):** Manages authentication and authorization for all the services in OpenStack.

**Image Service (Glance):** Manages disk images for VMs.
